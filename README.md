## About Me

Thank you for stumbling upon my profile! My name is Imtiaz Rahman raised in NYC. Outside of this "boring" stuff called coding I love to enjoy and appreciate music. I've caught along the hobby of playing the guitar by self teaching through Youtube. While I don't have much time due to work and projects, I always keep my guitar right by me so I can play whenever I get the chance. Cars would have to be my next major hobby. I can rant for hours discussing cars and what I love most about them. Currently trying to settle my family down with a house but once that goal has been dealt with, hopefully can start to act upon my rather expensive hobby of cars.
